## RANSAC Prolog

To test the ability to read point cloud, you can run the `test.pl`

    $ swipl test.pl

Once repl has started, you can initiate the test function:

    ?- testReadingFile.

This will read the file name **hardcoded** in the `test.pl` file. You can change the file name to test other point cloud files.
